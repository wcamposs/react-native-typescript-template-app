## Description:

## Prerequisites:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Cloning the repository:**

Assuming you have your machine pre-configured to clone github repositories (if you have not configured it, visit [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)), clone the repository using the following command in the terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:wcamposs/RNTemplateApp.git
```

**Installation and configuration:**

Install and configure the environment to run the application, following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@jeancabral/instalando-e-configurando-react-native-no-ubuntu-18-04-e3329ac090a0).

**Yarn Installation (optional):**

Yarn is a dependency manager, it is used to install the dependencies required for the project (it has the same role as **npm**). If you want to use it (personally I prefer), install it through [this tutorial](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable).

**Project dependencies installation:**

To install the dependency packages used in this project, follow the steps below:

After cloning the repository, access its root folder using the terminal and execute one of the commands below according to the package manager you use (npm or yarn):

1. Using Yarn:

```
yarn install
```

2. Using NPM:

```
npm install
```

After installation, the project can be considered configured and ready to run.

## Getting Started:

Assuming you are in the root directory via a terminal, run the following command to run Expo:

1. Using Yarn:

```
yarn start
```

2. Using NPM:

```
